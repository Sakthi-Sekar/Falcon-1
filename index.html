        <ul>
            <li>From your Segment UI’s Destinations page click on “Add Destination”.</li>
            <li>Search for “mabl” within the Destinations Catalog and confirm the Source you’d like to connect to.</li>
            <li>Drop the “API Key,” accessible from into your from your mabl workspace’s API keys page, into the Segment
                Settings UI.</li>
            <li>mabl processes the usage data into rolling 24 hour summaries hourly. It may take up to an hour for usage
                to
                begin to populate in your test coverage metrics.</li>

        <p>Only mabl offers scriptless cross-browser web testing, auto-healing tests, visual testing, and diagnostics in
            one simple service. mabl helps you improve the speed and quality of your release pipeline by allowing you to
            test every release, at scale, on a single platform, with no infrastructure to manage.

            NOTE: The mabl Destination is currently in beta, which means that they are still actively developing the
            destination. This doc was last updated on 10 June, 2019. If you are interested in joining their beta program
            or have any feedback to help improve the mabl Destination and its documentation, please let their team know!

        <p>You can send computed traits and audiences generated through Segment Personas to this destination as a user
            property. To learn more about Personas, reach out for a demo.

            For user-property destinations, an identify call will be sent to the destination for each user being added
            and removed. The property name will be the snake_cased version of the audience name you provide with a
            true/false value. For example, when a user first completes an order in the last 30 days, we will send an
            identify call with the property order_completed_last_30days: true, and when this user no longer satisfies we
            will set that value to false.

            When the audience is first created an identify call is sent for every user in the audience. Subsequent syncs
            will only send updates for those users which were added or removed since the last sync.</p>

            <li> Enter your Evergage Account Key (this is the subdomain you use to login to Evergage with; if your
                account is “testaccount.evergage.com”, then use “testaccount”);</li>
            <li> Finally, enter the name of the Evergage Dataset you want data to flow to (by default this is

            Destinations are business tools or apps that you can connect to the data flowing through Segment. Some of
            our most popular destinations are Google Analytics, Mixpanel, KISSmetrics, Customer.io, Intercom, and
            KeenIO.

            All of these tools run on the same data: who are your customers and what are they doing? But each tool
            requires that you send that data in a slightly different format, which means that you’d have to write code
            to track all of this information, again and again, for each tool, on each page of your app or website.

            We eliminate this process by introducing an abstraction layer. You send your data to us, and we understand
            how to translate it so we can send it along to any destination. You enable destinations from the catalog in
            the Segment App, and user data immediately starts flowing into those tools. No extra code required!

            We support many categories of destinations, from advertising to marketing, email to customer support, CRM to
            user testing, and even data warehouses. You can view a complete list of our destinations or check out our
            destination page for a searchable list broken down by category.

            A warehouse is a central repository of data collected from one or more sources. This is what commonly comes
            to mind you think about a relational database: structured data that fits neatly into rows and columns.

            In Segment, a Warehouse is a special type destination. Instead of streaming data to the destination all the
            time, we load data to them in bulk at a regular intervals. When we load data, we insert and update events
            and objects, and automatically adjust their schema to fit the data you’ve sent to Segment.
